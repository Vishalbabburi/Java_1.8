#Stream:
-It is an Interface present in java.util.stream package
-It contains many utility methods like map(), forEach(), filter(), collect() etc.
-Streams are used to process group of values like collections, arrays etc.
-we use stream() method on collection to create a stream for objects in that collection.
-we use Stream.of() method to create a stream for group of values including arrays.
- streams concept made functional programming easier as we could perform method chaining using several
intermediate operations like map(), forEach() etc.. and terminal operations like collect().
-streams concept helps us write efficient and concise code.
